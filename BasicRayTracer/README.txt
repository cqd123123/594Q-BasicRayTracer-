The result for final project is in BasicRayTracer/result - final/

I implemented some simple volumetric rendering techniques. The volume integrator support absorption, emission and single 
scattering effects. Two kind of volume smoke is supported: homogeneous somke and inhomogeneous somke. The smoke density file
is from Pbrt scene file. The dragon model is a .ply file.

The first image box smoke is rendered inside the cornell box. Single scattering is turned on. The smoke is illuminated using
the area light.

The second image is rendered with absorption only effect. The smoke is more like soot.
The third image is a dragon breathe smoke effect. The scattering effect is turned on.

The fourth image is using homogeneous somke density, with single scattering turned on, and using a area light source.
